Transform Yoga
Breathe
Pranayama, the yoga practice of breathing, helps to correct our often shallow breathing by tapping into the full healing power of deeper breathing. In addition to facilitating mental calm, when used as a frequent practice, Pranayama can help to address physical symptoms such as clearing nasal passages.
Stretch
Yoga increases your range of motion in muscles and joints through gentle, soothing movement that increases flexibility in your hamstrings, back, shoulders and hips.
Workout
Asana is the Sanskirt word for posture, or seat. In Yoga, asana practice is intensely physical, enhancing strength while also calming the mind.
Relax
We refer to yoga as a “practice” because it requires intense focus and concentration, thereby allowing you to put your daily life stressors aside and divert your mind toward your body and essential self.
